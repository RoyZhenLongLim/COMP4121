# University Class Scheduling Problem (USCP)

This repo is dedicated to Roy Lim z5310629's work for COMP4121 Advanced Algorithms.
*Abstract*
University Class Scheduling Problem (USCP) is an important but difficult problem for
universities due to the recent explosion in enrolments and courses. Currently, timetable
creation is done manually at UNSW due to the number of both hard and soft constraints,
tho UNSW has developed algorithms to assist the process. In addition, due to different
universities having different circumstances, there is no commercial solution suitable for
the problem yet. This project briefly analyzes and implements three different algorithms
and discusses how they can be augmented to solve the problem. The algorithms in ques-
tion are: Binary Integer Programming, Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Algorithm.
After implementing the algorithms, we determined that Ant Colony Optimization was the
most suitable candidate for a large-scale implementation due to its speed, flexibility, and
portability. Further optimization is required before the algorithm is ready to be used

Implementation of algorithms can be found in:
```shell
linearScheduler.py
geneticSchedule.py
antColonyScheduler.py
```

You can run them using their corrosponding `main.py` files.
