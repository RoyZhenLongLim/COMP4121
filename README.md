# University Class Scheduling Problem (USCP)

This repo is dedicated to Roy Lim z5310629's work for COMP4121 Advanced Algorithms.

Implementation of algorithms can be found in:
```shell
linearScheduler.py
geneticSchedule.py
antColonyScheduler.py
```

You can run them using their corrosponding `main.py` files.
