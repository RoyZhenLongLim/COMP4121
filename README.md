# University Class Scheduling Problem (USCP)

This repo is dedicated to Roy Lim z5310629's work for COMP4121 Advanced Algorithms.

## TODO:
- [ ] Write brief description of each the algorithms (what was implemented)
- [ ] Describe project structure
- [ ] Implemented Genetic Algorithm
- [ ] Implement Ant Colony Algorithm

# Linear Programming
Implemented with Python using Google OR-Tools
```
python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools
```
Run code using:
```
python3 Python/LinearProgramming/iter5.py
 ```

# Genetic Algorithm

# Ant Colony Algorithm
